## How it works

The goal of the project is to make an 8-bit resolution SAR ADC similar to a group project I didn in college. Currently what's available is the sample and hold circuit which was what I had worked on before during college in the team project.

I changed the sample and hold circuit to a simple transmission gate plus capacitor for simple layout and simulation. Those files have been updated and I will next do LVS to confirm layout is correct.

## How to test

Added the testbench to simulate. Should just be able to run the testbench, and it should save locally.

## External hardware

None currently
